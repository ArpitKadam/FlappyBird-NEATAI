FlappyBird-NEATAI is an AI-powered Flappy Bird game that uses the **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** algorithm. The AI learns to play by evolving through generations, improving its performance with each iteration. The best-performing AI is saved and can be replayed.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Gameplay**: The AI uses the NEAT algorithm to evolve over generations, getting better with each attempt.
- **Generational Learning**: The AI learns by trying to maximize its fitness score, which is calculated based on how long it survives.
- **Replay AI**: The best-performing AI is saved, and its behavior can be replayed.
- **Real-time Display**: The game window dynamically updates with the current score, generation, and number of birds alive.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The game is developed using Python and the Pygame library for graphical rendering and game logic.
- **NEAT**: The NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm is used to train the AI agents.
- **Pygame**: Pygame is used for creating the game environment, rendering images, and handling user input.
- **NEAT-Python**: The NEAT algorithm is implemented using the `neat-python` library.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install Python and the required libraries.

### Step 1: Install Python
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FlappyBird-NEATAI.git
cd FlappyBird-NEATAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Download Images
Ensure that the necessary image files for the game are placed in the imgs directory. These images are used for the bird, pipe, and background graphics. You can find placeholders for the images or design your own.

### Step 4: Run the Game
Run the file ```flappy_bird.py``` to get your own best **genome** by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python flappy_bird.py 
```

Run the file ```best_player.py``` to run your best **genome** by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python best_player.py
```

## How It Works

- NEAT Algorithm: The NEAT algorithm evolves a population of neural networks over multiple generations. Each network controls one bird in the game, and their fitness is determined by how long they survive.
- Fitness Calculation: The fitness is based on how long the bird survives without colliding with pipes or falling to the ground. The more the bird survives, the higher its fitness score.
- Generational Evolution: After each generation, the best-performing birds (AI agents) are selected to create new generations through crossover and mutation.

## Game Logic

- The bird moves up and down based on its velocity, which is adjusted every frame.
- Pipes are generated randomly at the top of the screen and move left to simulate the obstacles.
- If the bird collides with the pipes or the ground, it loses a fitness point and is removed from the simulation.
- If the bird survives through pipes, it earns a fitness point, and a new pipe is added.

## Configuring NEAT
The NEAT algorithm parameters can be configured in the ```config-feedforward.txt``` file, where you can tweak the following:

- Population Size: Number of genomes in each generation.
- Mutation Rate: How frequently new mutations occur.
- Crossover Rate: The rate at which new genomes are generated by combining traits from two parents.
